  <h3>How to Enable HTTPS</h3>
  <p>
  If you are reading this than HTTPS has likely been disabled. The majority of
  the Flight Web Suite will not function correctly.
  </p>
  <p>
  If you are the administrator for this environment, you can complete the
  following steps to start the HTTPS service.  If you are not the
  administrator, contact your administrator and ask them to do so.
  </p>

  <h3>Generate an SSL certificate</h3>
  <p>
  SSL certificates are generated with <code>flight www cert-gen</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
  <code>LetsEncrypt</code> can be used to generate a certificate if the
  machine is accessible via a public DNS by running:
  </p>
  <pre class="code-block"><code>flight www cert-gen --cert-type lets-encrypt --domain DOMAIN --email EMAIL</code></pre>

  <p>Alternatively a self-signed certificate can be generated by running:</p>
  <pre class="code-block"><code>flight www cert-gen --cert-type self-signed --domain $(hostname -d)</code></pre>

  <h3>Enable and Start HTTPS</h3>
  <p>You are now ready to start the HTTPS server by running:</p>
  <pre class="code-block"><code>flight www enable-https</code></pre>
