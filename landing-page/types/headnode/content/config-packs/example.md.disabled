This is an example config pack that you can copy to create your own.
Please refer to the following for the metadata specification:<br>
`/opt/flight/opt/www/landing-page/default/content/config-packs/example.md.disabled`

The listed `downloads` need to be stored in:<br>
`/opt/flight/usr/share/www/downloads/config-packs/<PACK_NAME>/`

The `PACK_NAME` is the metadata file name without the file extension.

In this case, the paths will be:<br>
`/opt/flight/usr/share/www/downloads/config-packs/example/README.md`
`/opt/flight/usr/share/www/downloads/config-packs/example/example.tar.gz`

You may hide this config pack by removing the symlink:<br>
`rm /opt/flight/opt/www/landing-page/default/content/config-packs/example.md`

NOTE: Disabling a config pack will remove it from the landing page.  However,
the files stored at
`/opt/flight/usr/share/www/downloads/config-packs/<PACK_NAME>/` will remain
accessible for download until they are removed.
